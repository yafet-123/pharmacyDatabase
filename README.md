you are required to do a rough database design for a pharmacy system  and show the relationship between each class
1.the application will need to login employees,administrators ,customers
2.each customer  will have a prescription that needs to be filled
3.the system must send notifications to the customer  when the medication is about to end 
4.the admin can look at what medicine is in stock and how many there is left 
5.the employees only responsibility is to login and to dispense medication when the customer comes 

please do a rough object modelling and rough database design please clearly state the relationships between the classes and entities
